    <h1>Connecting to MongoDB</h1>
    <h2>Principle</h2>
    The connect dialog can be used to create a MongoClient instance connected to a MongoDB single instance, replica set, or sharded cluster.
    Several MongoClient instances can be connected and managed by UMongo.
    <h2>Options</h2>
    The following options are supported:<ul>
        <li>URI: the MongoDB URI like 'mongodb://...'. See specifications at <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/connection-string/">http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/connection-string/</a></li>
        <li>Servers: Comma separated list of servers to connect to. Typically a single mongod or mongos server is required.</li>
        <li>Connection Mode: the default is "Automatic" and should be used for a replica set or a sharded cluster. The "Direct" mode is used to connect directly to a single server.</li>
        <li>Databases: Optional, a comma separated list of databases to use. If empty, all databases will be detected.</li>
        <li>User: Optional, the user name for authentication. The authentication will be used for either the provided databases or 'admin'.</li>
        <li>Password: Optional, the password for authentication</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Advanced options</h2>
    The following options are supported:<ul>
        <li>socketType: type of socket to use. Currently 'Plain', 'SSL' and 'SSL no validation' are supported</li>
        <li>connectTimeout: Timeout for the socket connect operation</li>
        <li>socketTimeout: Timeout for the socket read/write operations</li>
        <li>safeWrites: Sets the global WriteConcern as SAFE, which means that writes are acknowledged by the server</li>
        <li>secondaryReads: Allows the read operations to go to secondary servers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Proxy options</h2>    
    The following options are supported:<ul>
        <li>proxyType: Type of proxy. Currently 'None' and 'SOCKS' are supported</li>        
        <li>proxyHost: The proxy host</li>        
        <li>proxyPort: The proxy port</li>        
    </ul>
    If MongoDB is not accessible from your local machine, but you can SSH to a server that can connect, do the following:<ul>
        <li>create a SOCKS proxy from your terminal by using 'ssh -D LocalPort hostWithDBAccess -N'. An example port is 9000</li>
        <li>when connecting, set proxyType to 'SOCKS', proxyHost to 'localhost' and proxyPort to 9000.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    Following are possible connections:
    <ul>
        <li>To connect directly to a single secondary server: input the server name in "servers", select "direct" connection mode, check "secondary reads" box</li>
    </ul>
